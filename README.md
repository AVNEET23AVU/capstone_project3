The Pokedox web application is a responsive, interactive platform where users can explore, view, and "catch" Pokémon using data from the Pokémon API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app displays Pokémon in batches, loading additional entries with each click of the "Load More" button. Each Pokémon entry includes a thumbnail and name, and users can view more details, including a larger image, height, weight, colour  and abilities by clicking on a Pokémon. A "Catch" button lets users add Pokémon to their collection, which is saved in local storage to persist between sessions, with options to release caught Pokémon as desired.
